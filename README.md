# ThriveAPI Media Tool
A tool used to upload new media items to the Thrive Church Official API.

## Purpose
The idea behind this tool is to make it easier for the tech team to be able to upload new media items / series' to the [Thrive Church Official API](https://github.com/ThriveCommunityChurch/ThriveChurchOfficialAPI/). For the context of this application, that API is a "[black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box/)". So we'll need to interface with that API but we don't need to be able to do anything other than call those routes with the correct information.
